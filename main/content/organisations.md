## Ayton Gardening Society

The Ayton & District Horticultural Society Show has been a part of village life since the inaugural show in 1881. The ‘Flower Show’ as everyone knows it has taken place every year since then – even through both world wars.
Unfortunately Covid proved an even greater menace and the show had to take a breather for a couple of years.
Now there is a new society running the show and its first show in 2022 was a great success with the addition of numerous stalls and activities including an appearance by the Norham Village Band.
Not only does this new society run the annual show but it also provides other community events such as garden visits, coffee mornings, plant and bulb sales.

The Ayton Show is one of the highlights of the village year and is regarded by many as one of the best horticultural shows in Berwickshire and beyond. The show was held in the Volunteer Hall on the Eyemouth road until the hall was demolished in the 1970s to make way for housing. Since then it has been held in Ayton Primary School, another 1970s building.
