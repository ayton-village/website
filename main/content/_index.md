Ayton is an attractive village in the East Berwickshire part of the Scottish Borders, with a population of around 500. The main A1 road ran through the village until the 1980s when a bypass road was built.

We have a [primary school](https://aytonprimary.com) with around 80 pupils and a really well stocked [village shop](https://www.facebook.com/aytonminimart/). The mobile branch of RBS visits once a week on a Friday (10:00&ndash;10:30). The Post Office's outreach has ceased, the closest branches are in [Reston](https://www.postoffice.co.uk/branch-finder/1458302/reston) and [Eyemouth](https://www.postoffice.co.uk/branch-finder/2078309/eyemouth).

The mobile branch of the RBS visits the village every Friday morning from 10:00 to 10:30. It parks on the High Street just up from the clock tower. The times for Eyemouth are Wednesdays from 10:00 to 11:00 and Fridays from 10:45 to 11:45.

Within a mile of the village we have the beautiful [Ayton Castle](https://aytoncastle.co.uk), built in the 1850s in the Scottish Baronial style in red sandstone.

The village defibrillator is situated in the Community Hall vennel.
