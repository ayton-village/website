Council (hereinafter referred to as “the Scheme”).

## 3. Purposes/Functions

3.1 In addition to any other purpose which it may pursue, a Community Council shall:

1. ascertain, co-ordinate and express to the Scottish Borders Council as the Local Authority for its area, and to other public authorities, the views of the community which it represents in relation to matters for which those authorities are responsible;

3. take such action in the interests of that community as appears to it to be expedient and practicable.

3.2 The Council shall be non-party in politics and non-discriminatory and shall represent all
persons in its area.

## 4. Composition of the Council

4.1 The Council shall be composed of:

1. 12 members who have been elected in the manner prescribed in the Scheme and
2. the Scottish Borders Councillor for the area covered by the Council or any part of it, who shall have ex officio membership of the Community Council during their period of office for the Local Authority but shall have no entitlement to vote, move motions or amendments, or hold office in the Community Council. No Member of the Scottish Borders Council may simultaneously be a member of the Community Council other than in an ex officio capacity.

4.2 The Council may include co-opted members in the following circumstances:

1. The Council may co-opt further members with skills or knowledge which the Council considers would be of assistance to the Council in carrying out its functions. Such co-opted members shall not have voting rights, shall not be entitled to move motions or amendments, and shall not hold office, and may be of any age. Members co-opted for this purpose will serve for such time as may be determined by the Council at the time of their co-option or until the Council decide that their services are no longer required; and
2. The Council may, where the elected membership does not comprise the maximum number of elected members specified in paragraph 4.1(a) above but is equal to, or exceeds, one-half of that number, or where casual vacancies arise during a term of office, co-opt persons who would be eligible for election to the Community Council as members in order to make up that number, subject to the number of members so co-opted not at any one time exceeding one quarter of the maximum number of elected members specified in paragraph 4.1(a) above. For the purposes of this sub-paragraph, any fraction arising shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. Members so co-opted may serve until the next ordinary election to the Council, qualifying for full voting rights after attending 3 meetings or six months after co-option (whichever is shorter).

4.3 In the event of the number of elected Members of the Council, in the interval between
elections, reducing to less than one-half of the maximum number specified in paragraph
4.1 (a) above, a by-election shall be held not later than two months after this reduction
occurs (unless the next ordinary election is due to occur within six months of the
reduction occurring). The number of vacancies to be filled at the by-election shall be the
number by which the elected membership falls short of the maximum.

## 5. Method of Co-option of Members

5.1 A proposal to co-opt a person or persons to the Council under paragraph 4.2(b) hereof
shall require a Notice of Motion to that effect to be included on the Agenda for the
appropriate meeting of the Council, and such Notice of Motion shall include the name
