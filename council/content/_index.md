## What is a Community Council?

Under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, all of Scotlandâ€™s local authorities are legally obliged to set up Community Councils.

These are legally recognised groups of local people with an interest in their community. The main role of Community Councils is to represent their local area, to consult with local residents, and pass their views on to public sector organisations such as Scottish Borders Council, NHS Borders, Lothian and Borders Police and the Scottish Government.

Community Councils also fulfil an important role in helping to facilitate local projects and can act as a vehicle for drawing down funding from sources such as the local authority, Scottish Government, or the EU, through the South of Scotland European Partnership.

## Village Defibrillator

The Community Council purchased and maintains the village defibrillator. The defibrillator is situated in the Community Hall vennel.
