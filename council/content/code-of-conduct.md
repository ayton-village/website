## 1. General

1.1 Community Councillors are expected to show the highest
standards of personal conduct in the performance of their duties
at all times.

1.2 Their duty is to the whole community served by their
Community Council. This Code should be used to guide their
conduct as a Community Councillor. It is their responsibility to
make sure that they are familiar with this Code and that their
conduct meets it.

1.3 Community Councillors should promote and support these
principles by leadership and example, always acting in such a
way as to protect public confidence in the Community Council.

## 2. Service to the Community

2.1 Community Councillors have a duty to act in the interests of the
local community which they have been elected to represent.
They also have a duty to act in accordance with the remit of
Scottish Borders Council’s Scheme for the Establishment of
Community Councils as set out under the terms of the Local
Government (Scotland) Act 1973).

2.2 They have a duty to establish and reflect, through the
Community Council, the views of the community as a whole, on
any issue, irrespective of personal opinion.

2.3 They should make sure that they are, within reason, accessible
to their local community. Various mechanisms to allow the
general community to express their views, i.e. internet, social
media, suggestion boxes, community surveys and opinion polls
should, where possible, be made available.

## 3. Duty to Uphold the Law

3.1 Community Councillors must uphold the law and act on all
occasions in line with the public trust placed in them.

3.2 Community Councillors have a responsibility to play their part in
ensuring that the Community Council uses its resources
prudently and in accordance with the law.

## 4 Community Interest

4.1 Community Councillors should act to assist the Community
Council, as far as possible, in the interests of the whole
community that it serves.

## 5. Selflessness

5.1 Community Councillors should act only in the public interest.
They should never use their position as a Community Councillor
to gain for themselves, their family or friends, any financial
benefits, preferential treatment or other advantage, or to grant
such benefits, treatment or advantage improperly to others.

## 6. Integrity and Propriety

6.1 Community Councillors should not put themselves in a position
where their integrity is called into question by any financial or
other obligations. As well as avoiding actual impropriety they
should avoid any appearance of it.

## 7. Hospitality

7.1 Community Councillors should record all gifts and hospitality,
with a monetary value above £50, received in connection with
membership of the Community Council. They should not accept
gifts or hospitality that might reasonably be thought to
influence, or be intended to influence, their judgement; or
where to do so could bring discredit upon the Community
Council.

## 8. Decisions

8.1 Whilst Community Councillors may be influenced by the views
of others, including particular interest groups, it is their
responsibility to decide what view to take, and how to vote, on
any question which Community Councillors have to decide.

## 9. Accountability and Stewardship

9.1 Community Councillors are accountable through the community
they serve for their actions and their part in reaching decisions
and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate
to their office.

9.2 Community Councillors should individually and collectively make
sure that annual accounts are produced showing the financial
undertakings of the Community Council. They must also make
sure that all resources are used efficiently, effectively and fairly.

## 10. Openness

10.1 Community Councillors should be as open as possible about all
their actions and their part in reaching decisions. They should
seek to ensure that reasons are given for decisions of their
Community Council.

10.2 When dealing with the media, members of the public, or other
not directly involved in the Community Council all Community
Councillors should make sure that that an explicit distinction is
made between the expression of their personal views and
opinions from any views or statement made about or on behalf
of the Community Council.

## 11. Confidentiality

11.1 Community Councillors should ensure that confidential material,
including material about individuals, is handled appropriately
with regard to the public interests and is not used for private
purposes.

## 12. Participation

12.1 Community Councillors may take part in the consideration of
questions which come before the Community Council unless
they have a private interest, which would cause their
participation to raise questions as to their impartiality.

## 13. Declarations

13.1 Community Councillors must declare any private interests
relating to their Community Council duties and should take
steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way that protects the
public interest. They should make relevant declarations of
interest at meetings of the Community Council, Sub-Committees or Working Groups to which they are appointed,
and in all circumstances where they are active in their role as a
Community Councillor.

13.2 If Community Councillors have a private interest in a matter
before their Community Council, they should consider whether it
is appropriate for them to declare this interest and withdraw
from discussion and decision making on that matter. In
considering this they should have regard to the following
criteria:

1. That members of the public might reasonably think the private interest could influence them; and
2. That members of the public might reasonably think the private interest creates a real danger of bias on the part of the Community Councillor because it affects them or someone connected with them, more than any other person or more than the generality of other persons affected by the matter.

   13.3 In the case of a private interest that meets neither of these
   criteria, there may be no reason to declare the interest or to
   take any further action.

   13.4 In the case of a private interest which meets criteria 1,
   Community Councillors should declare their interest but they
   may decide to participate in the discussion and decision making
   on the matter.

   13.5 In the case of a private interest which meets criteria 2,
   Community Councillors should declare their interest and
   withdraw from the discussion and decision making on the
   matter.

   13.6 In the case of a private interest which meets both criteria 1 & 2
   and if this private interest is of a continuing nature, it may be
   that it would cause a Community Councillor to withdraw from
   the consideration of business on such a frequent basis that they
   would be of little value to their Community Council. In this case,
   they should not seek to serve as a Community Councillor.

   13.7 Private financial interests may be more likely to be of a nature
   that meet the above criteria however private non-financial
   interests may also meet the criteria. The fundamental principle
   to bear in mind is that Community Councillors should not do
   anything that they cannot justify to the public in terms of this
   code.

## 14. Respect

14.1 Community councillors must respect their fellow Community
Councillors and those that they represent, treating them with
courtesy, respect and in a non-discriminatory manner at all
times.

## 15. Relations With Scottish Borders Council Councillors

15.1 Community Councillors should respect the role of Scottish
Borders Council Elected Members and treat them in a way that
engenders mutual respect at all times.

## 16. Relations With Scottish Borders Council Employees

16.1 Community Councillors should respect the role of officers of
Scottish Borders Council who are directly responsible to Scottish
Borders Council and treat them in a way that engenders mutual
respect at all times.

## 17. Political Affiliations

17.1 Whilst Community Councillors are free to have political
affiliations, the Community Council itself is not a political body
but exists to represent the interests of the whole community.
Therefore, in participating in the business of the Community
Council, the concern of Community Councillors must be to
represent the interests of their community and not those of a
particular political party or group.

## 18. Personal Conduct

18.1 Community Councillors’ personal conduct should be such as not
to bring the Council into disrepute. They should act courteously
to fellow Community Councillors, Scottish Borders Council
Elected Members and Officers, members of the public and other
bodies.
