## Welcome to the Ayton Gardening Society!

The prime purpose of the Society is to organise and run the Ayton Show, including ancillary fundraising for this (Such as with our coffee mornings and cake and plant sales.)

If you're here to find more information about the Ayton and District Show, including a downloadable schedule, [you can see it all here.](/ayton-show-2025/)

Previously, the Ayton & District Horticultural Society Show had been a part of village life since the inaugural show in 1881. The ‘Flower Show’ as everyone knows it, has taken place every year since then – even through both world wars. Unfortunately Covid proved an even greater menace and the show had to take a breather for a couple of years. Now the new Ayton Gardening Society is running the show, and since our first show in 2022 it has been a great success with the addition of numerous stalls and activities including an appearance by the Norham Village Band, and many children's activities. Last year (2024) we also added some vintage cars, which were very popular with our visitors.

We also organise other occasional activities, such as visits to gardens and some classes. Details of these will be advertised on our Facebook and Instagram pages (links at the bottom of the page).

We always welcome new members, as well as volunteers who are willing to help at the show and with planning and organisation. Please email *aytongardens@outlook.com*
