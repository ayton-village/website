## Ingredients

* 100 g plain flour
* ¼ level tsp ground ginger
* ¼ level tsp ground mixed spice
* ¼ level tsp ground cinnamon
* ½ level tsp bicarbonate of soda
* 50 g softened butter
* 50 g caster sugar
* 75 g golden syrup

## Steps

1. Measure the flour, spices and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Rub the butter into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs, then mix in the sugar.
2. Gently heat the golden syrup and stir into the mixture to make a soft dough. Roll the dough into 24 balls roughly the size of a cherry and place on a lightly greased baking tray, allowing room for them to spread.
3. Bake in a preheated oven for about 10 minutes, then take the baking tray out of the oven and carefully hit on a solid surface to make the biscuits crack and spread. Bake for a further 5 minutes until they are a good even brown. Lift off the baking tray and leave to cool on a wire rack.
