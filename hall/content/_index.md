You can find Ayton Community Hall up the vennel next to the Hemelvaart Bier Cafe (previously the Black Bull pub) on the High Street. Itâ€™s only been the Community Hall since the end of March 2008. Prior to that, the hall was owned by Ayton and Burnmouth Church. 

The hall consists of a modern kitchen, ladies, gents and disabled toilet facilities, foldaway chairs and tables, digital projector and sound system, with a sound loop for the hard of hearing. There is cinema equipment to show DVDS and Blu-rays.

 Outside there is a secure garden with a barbeque and seating on a patio area.



One of the village defibrillators is situated in the Community Hall vennel.
