## This Friday, 19 December at 7:30 we will be showing 'The Holiday'. 

Iris and Amanda (played by Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet) couldn't be more different - one lives in a cosy English cottage, the other in a swanky Hollywood estate - but they are alike in their mutual bad luck with men. In desperate need of an escape, they meet online and impulsively switch homes. Both find the last thing either wants or expects - a new romance - and discover that a change of address really can change your life.

 From the Director of Something's Gotta Give and What Women Want comes two whole hours of sheer, heart-warming romantic comedy.
